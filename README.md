# CS330-PLP---Swift

## What is this?
This is a repository created to track my progress in my Programming Language Project assigned in my Structure and Organization of Programming Languages class.
This project involves choosing an unknown-to-me programming language to learn on my own time, and record my discoveries.

## History
I chose to learn Swift as my programming language, as I am an Apple user and it seemed like this would be a good way to know the system I am using. It was created underneath Chris Lattner, who was a lead developer in Apple, in order to replace the company’s old programming language which had become nearly obsolete. It started off as a proprietary language, but became open source in 2015. 
It is written primarily for Apple systems, but also supports Linux and – more recently – Windows. It is able to program software for a variety of situations, from PCs, mobile devices, and webservers. It seems that most people use it to develop applications to be used on Apple devices. So far, I have found most of the information about Swift through the documentations of its website and its GitHub community, but I also found out that Apple has an app that I can download that is specifically to teach people how to code in it. There is also a free book on Swift in the Apple Bookstore available.

## Getting Started
I downloaded Swift using the bash command provided on their website in my Terminal. Swift does has a specific environment to use –Xcode – which, after I did the software update I had been putting off, I downloaded from the AppStore. There is also a VSCode extension, whose link was provided on the website, and I downloaded it as well. Swift supports single-line comments using two forward slashes, as well as multi-line comments opened using forward slash followed by an asterisk (/*) and closed with the opposite (*/). You can also use this to nest other multiline comments inside each other.
